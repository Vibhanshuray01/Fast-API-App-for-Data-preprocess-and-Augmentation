# FastAPI Image and Text Preprocessing and Augmentation

This project demonstrates the use of FastAPI for building an application that allows you to upload, preprocess, and augment text and image files. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly web interface where users can interact with data by uploading text, image, and audio files, apply preprocessing and augmentation techniques, and view the results in real time.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Remove special characters, standardize text for further processing.
- **Text Augmentation**: Apply transformations like synonym replacement and filler word insertion to create varied datasets.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and adjust brightness for image datasets.
- **Image Augmentation**: Perform transformations such as rotation, brightness adjustments, and grayscale conversion to generate new variations of images.

## Tech Stack
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **Python**: A versatile programming language used to write the backend logic for preprocessing and augmentation.
- **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork for image processing tasks.
- **PyTorch** (if used for model-based augmentation).
- **JavaScript**: To handle file uploads and display results dynamically on the frontend.

## Requirements

You can install all necessary dependencies using the following command after setting up your virtual environment:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name

   2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Run the application:
uvicorn app:app --reload
Your application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Usage
Visit the FastAPI application on your browser.
Upload a text or image file.
Apply preprocessing and augmentation transformations.
View the results, including transformed text, preprocessed images, or augmented images.
